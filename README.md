Workout Creater		

Workout Creater will allow you to create workouts with your favorite exercises. It also allows you to create sets and repitition requirements for each exercise so that you can achieve your fitness goals.

Tecnologies used:
For this project I used, javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Mongoose, Express, AJAX, and Bootstrap. 

Existing Features
As of now the application will allow you to create delete and read workouts. 

Planned Features
I would like the application to be able to show the requirements for the workout and then let the user record what he/she actually achieved. The user would then be able to look at all the in instances of the workout and see how they have progressed.
